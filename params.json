Click one of these to make it show up in the [editor](#3).\r\n\r\n> If you're creating a new theme all of these will be blank.\r\n\r\n### 2\r\nFrom left to right:\r\n\r\n> Background Color. This is the color that fills the background.\r\n\r\n> Foreground Color. This is the color that you paint with in the foreground.\r\n\r\n### 3\r\n> The painting area. The item you click in the list from #1 will be modified.\r\n\r\n> The color you paint will be the foreground from #2. You will also paint with the variable you have selected in #5.\r\n\r\n> If you have painted with a variable a red box will appear around the pixel. You can hover over it to see what var was used.\r\n\r\n### 4\r\n> The width and height of the area you're working with. You can change this then press \"Okay\" to modify the values.\r\n\r\n> **This will destroy all your work on the current area.**\r\n\r\n### 5\r\n\r\n> A list of GTK variables you can use. They will change based on the current theme you have set.\r\n\r\n> When you paint with these you can see a red box around the pixel you painted.\r\n> You can then hover over this box and see what variable was used.\r\n\r\n### 6\r\n\r\nFrom left to right:\r\n> Theme name: The name of folder to create when you press 'Export'\r\n\r\n> Export: Exports the current theme to a .tar.gz file. You can then copy this file to your .themes folder and extract it.\r\n\r\n> Load: Loads an already existing theme. This has to be the xfwm4 folder or a folder with xfwm4 in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note:\r\n\r\nI may add themerc file support sometime in the future. Depends on how much people use this / want it.\r\n\r\nCurrently some of the code isn't commented or is a little messy. I plan to clean it up.\r\n",
